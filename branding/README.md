# Branding Guide

## About The Brand

The brand name and logo are the representation of our company and any usage for any purpose besides recognition of our company is strictly prohibited. The flat-top pyramid with its shading and stairs, symbolize ascension, enlightenment, and the connection between the earthly and divine realms. We refer to AZTEQ Metaverse products as the **Technology from the Gods** and our symbol, the flat-top pyramid, represents this. In our products we use the “speed lines” to represent the frustrum of a perspective camera. Each product is named in capital typography, hence that “AZTEQ” in AZTEQ Metaverse is capitalized as it represents the coin AZTEQ, which is the product that powers the metaverse surrounding our products. In writing, always refer to our registered trademark “AZTEQ Metaverse”, with “AZTEQ” in capitals and “Metaverse” with the first character capitalized (the “M”) to reflect our business and its activities. 

We restrict the usage of our logo and company name from any deformation. Partners, affiliates and press should always follow the guidelines from this document and use the source files from the provided resource bundle. If there is a requirement for a special file type or customization, do reach out to us as we will happily provide you with additional source files.
